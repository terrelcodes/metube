# MeTube

MeTube is a media curation platform. The goal is to create a space where one can curate videos from various sources, comment on them, share them, and discuss what is learned. 

It also allows you to track how much time you spend and how you spend it. This will allow you to set goals and track your conformance to them. For example, you could set up a channel with educational content on a particular topic. For each video, you can track your watch time, your note-taking time, and your "extra study" time (e.g. solving related problems or working on related projects). You can rate each video and choose favorite clips. You could even share the best content up to the point of creating a full course.

YouTube aleady tracks much of this information for their own benefit and for the benefit of their advertisers. Do they offer it to you for your benefit? No. Take back your data.
